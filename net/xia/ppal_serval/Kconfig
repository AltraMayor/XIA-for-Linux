	  Serval Principal adds service-centric networking to XIA.
	  A short, _inacurate_ description would be that Serval brings
	  TCP to XIA. See http://www.serval-arch.org/ for more
	  information.
	  If you have added XIA, you likely want to add this principal
	  to support reliable connections.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer M.
